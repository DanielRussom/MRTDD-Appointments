## How to run tests
After pulling down the repo, simply type `npm test` in the terminal of the root folder.

This only needs to be run manually once per session, as it's set to rerun any time a file is changed.

## How to run application
After pulling down the repo, first type `npm run build` in the terminal of the root folder.

After that is complete, open the `dist/index.html` file in a browser.
